Query **IEC 62443, NIST 800-82, NIST 800-53, and MITRE ATT&CK for ICS** — the complete OT security framework stack — directly from Claude, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible client.

If you're securing industrial control systems, manufacturing plants, energy infrastructure, or critical OT environments, this is your security standards reference.

Built by [Ansvar Systems](https://ansvar.eu) — Stockholm, Sweden

## Why This Exists

OT security standards are scattered across ISA PDFs, NIST publications, and MITRE matrices. Whether you're:
- A **control systems engineer** implementing IEC 62443 security levels
- A **security architect** designing network segmentation with the Purdue Model
- A **compliance officer** mapping NIS2 requirements to IEC controls
- A **threat hunter** investigating MITRE ATT&CK for ICS techniques
- A **product team** building secure PLCs, SCADA systems, or industrial IoT devices

...you shouldn't need to juggle 6 different documentation sites and 200 pages of standards. Ask Claude. Get the exact requirement. With context.

This MCP server makes **OT security standards searchable, cross-referenceable, and AI-readable**.

## 🎬 See It In Action

### Why This Works

**Authoritative Source Data:**
- **IEC 62443**: User-supplied (licensed standards) — you provide your own licensed data
- **NIST 800-53**: Automated OSCAL ingestion from official NIST GitHub
- **NIST 800-82**: Curated guidance from official PDF publication
- **MITRE ATT&CK**: Automated STIX 2.0 ingestion from official MITRE repository
- All data stored in SQLite with full-text search (FTS5)

**Smart Architecture:**
- Security level filtering uses junction tables (many-to-many relationships)
- Zone/conduit guidance generates markdown with Purdue Model context
- Requirement rationale includes regulatory drivers and related standards
- Cross-standard mappings use confidence scores for quality assessment

**Technical Stack:**
```
Official Source → Parse → Validate → SQLite → MCP Tools → AI Response
     ↑                        ↑            ↑
  OSCAL/STIX          JSON Schema    FTS5 Search
```

### Example: Traditional vs. This MCP

| Traditional Approach | This MCP Server |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Buy IEC 62443 PDFs ($500+) | Ingest your licensed IEC data once |
| Navigate 300+ page security level tables | *"What requirements apply to SL-2?"* → instant answer |
| Manual Purdue Model diagrams | `get_zone_conduit_guidance` → generated architecture |
| Cross-reference NIST ↔ IEC manually | `compare_ot_requirements` → mapped instantly |
| Search MITRE matrices by hand | *"Show me PLC attacks"* → filtered techniques |
| 6 different documentation sites | One unified query interface |

**Traditional example:** Open IEC 62443-3-3 PDF → Find security level table → Ctrl+F "SR 1" → Read 15 pages → Cross-reference to IEC 62443-4-2 → Repeat for NIST

**This MCP:** *"What are all IEC 62443 requirements for Security Level 2 targeting embedded devices?"* → Done.

>
> **Always:**
> - Conduct proper risk assessments for your specific environment
> - Engage qualified OT security professionals for implementation guidance
> - Verify against official standard publications
> - Follow your organization's security policies and procedures

### NIST & MITRE Data

## About Ansvar Systems

We build AI-accelerated threat modeling and compliance tools for automotive OEMs, Tier 1 suppliers, industrial manufacturers, and critical infrastructure operators. This MCP server started as our internal IEC 62443 reference tool — turns out everyone securing OT environments has the same "6 documentation sites, 12 PDFs" problem.

So we're open-sourcing it. Navigating IEC 62443 security levels shouldn't require a spreadsheet and a law degree.
